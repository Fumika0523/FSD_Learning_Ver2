XMLHttpRequest:XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. This enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is doing.

Fetch API:provides and interface for fetching resources(including across the network) newer than xmlhttprequest and more powerful and flexible.

The JSON.parse() static method parses a JSON string, constructing the JavaScript value or object described by the string. An optional reviver function can be provided to perform a transformation on the resulting object before it is returned.
EXAMPLE>>>>
const json = '{"result":true, "count":42}';
const obj = JSON.parse(json);

const obj1 = {
    name: "Fumika",
    place: "Japan",
    id: "12345", 
    age: 25   //if its a number, you dont write ""
}
// json, leftside and rightside need ""
const jsonObj = {
    "name":"fumika",
    "place":"Japan",
    "id":"12345",
    "age":25
    }


console.log(obj.count);
// Expected output: 42

console.log(obj.result);
// Expected output: true

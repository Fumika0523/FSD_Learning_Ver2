React was introduced in 2013 by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook.

We love: faster internet mobile internet, durable battery.

Most popular social platforms:Facebook, Youtube, FB Messanger, Istagram, LinkedIn, TikTok,Twitter,Snapchat

2009-2019, the rise of mobile traffic was rapidly rised, but 2020 dropped due to Covid

Cost of mobile internet around the World:
- India is the lowest 0.26 dollar
-Switzerland:20 dollar

Web Application: You can write a message, store the pw data.

Website: you can read / watch only.

Understanding by Browser @ HTML , CSS, JS

but React JS cannot understand the 3 languages

Webpack,Babel are the translator/complier

SPA:Single Page Application.
Only required data is loaded, good performance.
Data Saving.

Sequential Experience(Web): Loading time is huge

Fluid Experience(Mobile): Loading time is low

In Components, you can design with class,object,inline-style.
It has to be used 1 between object / inline-style. combination of class & object , class & inline-style are ok.

 {} > because writing a js, {{}} > for the object
 JS inside the HTML

style={{backgroundColor:"blue",height:"100px",width:"100px",marginBottom:"1%"}} >>>> inline-style
 const myDesign={
        backgroundColor:"grey",
    }
style={myStyle} >>>> Object style

Components Reusibility:
before function, state "import xx from './xxx' "
within return <> </>, you can reuse the component.
EX:
import Message from './Message'
function Welcome(){
    return(
        <>
        <div style={{backgroundColor:"blue",height:"100px",width:"100px",marginBottom:"1%"}}>Hello World</div>
        <Message/>
        <Message/>
        </>
    )
}
export default Welcome

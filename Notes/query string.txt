Options: you need to put this to the URL in Postman
it is coming from req.query, its about query string
req.query is object


?fumika=nodejs <<<< 
console.log(req.query.fumika)

?limit=5
console.log(req.query.limit)

?skip=10
console.log(req.query.skip)

?completed=true
console.log(req.query.completed)

?completed=false
console.log(req.query.completed)

http://localhost:8002/task?completed=true&limit=2&skip=7

VSCODE:
ex)
try{
	if(req.query.completed){		<<< only filter about true || false will taken care of ..
	match.completed=req.query.completed=="true"
	}
	const getUser = await req.user.populate({
	path:"taskRel",
	match:match,	
	options:{
	limit:parseInt(req.query.limit),
	skip:parseInt(req.user.skip)	
	}

})

POSTMAN:
1. limit >> limit the number of response
ex) ?limit = 5 (when you want to show only 5 responses)

2. Skip >> Skip the beginning of response
ex) ?skip=5 (skipping the first 5 responses

3.match >>> match is taking an object >> mongodb agg method >>  true || Boolean -- it'll automatically understand it has to be false

task?completed=true
task?completed=false

combination of two:
task?completed=true&limit=5 <<< 5 completed task will show

task?completed=false&limit=5 <<< 5 task that is not completed will show

task?completed=true&skip=5 <<<< completed task will show but first 5 tasks will be skipped

task?completed=false&skip=5 <<< not completed task will show but first 5 tasks will be skipped

task?limit=5&skip=3  << showing only 5 tasks but first 3 tasks will be skipped

combination of three:
task?completed=true&limit=15&skip=5  <<< 15 completed tasks will be shown but
first 5 tasks will be skipped

task?completed=false&limit=10&skip=2	<< 10 not completed tasks will be shown but first 2 tasks will be skipped

context API
-Context you can store a data and need to put in a main component(App.jx) and you can re-use it to other components.
-1. create a context in utils folder by using createContext().
-2. use this in App.jsx which is Root Component alongside with useState Variable with a value {[val,setval]}
ex)
<contextCreatedName.Provider alue={[val,setVal]}>

</contextCreatedName.Provider>

useContext(), whenever I need the data in the component, you can use it wherever you want to use it.
ex)
const stateVariable= useContext(contextCreatedName)

//prop drilling shouldn't be happened


Movie' generic statement about movie, replace with Message.

Local state Variable
useState Variable >> Prop drilling

---------------------------------------------

Wherever a button is pressed 
An action is dispatched, that action calls up the reducer function and that reducer function is responsible to update the store


When we want data from redux store
We have to subscribe the store, By using useSelector(), we can subscribe the store, fetch the data and update in UI.

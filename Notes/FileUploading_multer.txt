--------------------

userRoute.js

Upload image:
const multer=require('multer')
//create a variable called upload, to store the multer method and hence this multer method will be used.this multer method contains the object where all the validation has to b passed related to the file which we are uploading
-dest >> takes an object, stores all the images, it takes a path where all the images we want to store
-limit >> takes an object, fileSize of the file which we are uploading (ex: 1000000 <<<1MB) accordingly we can put the values as per our application requirement
-fileFilter >> this is a function/method. 
it takes parameters >>> (req,file,cb) ,
file >> this is the file which we are uploading
cb >> cb is the place where we will mention our error
-endWith : Boolean method to check the file type

const upload=multer({
dest:"profileImages/", 	<<<< the destination that you wanna upload your image
limits:{
	fileSize:1000000 <<<1MB  << IF you wanna limite the filesize
},

function to control which files are accepted
fileFilter(req,file,cb){
console.log(file.originalname)	<<< consoling in VScode terminal
       let fileNameVal=file.originalname.endsWith(".jpg")||file.originalname.endsWith(".jpeg")||file.originalname.endsWith(".png" <<<<< get the file original name  
         if(fileNameVal){
            console.log("File is uploaded") 
        }else{
            //error
            console.log("Please upload a correct file")
            return cb(new Error("Please upload a correct file")) //throw new Error("")
        }
        cb(undefined,true) // null|| undefined, << to accept the file pass 'true' 
    }
})


- upload.single() >>> its a method given by multer, we are storing multer method in upload variable, all the features and methods of the multer method can b directly used by using upload variable. this upload provides a single method (upload.single())
upload.single() takes 1 argument, which we pass it from postman(front-end) since it is a post request, we have to the pass it inside the Body, then inside the form-data, update the key as that argument, 
EXAMPLE)
key will be avatar and value will be the file uploaded.
that key name we have to pass it to the upload.single('avatar')


router.post('/user/profile/upload',upload.single('avatar'),(req,res)=>{
    res.send({message:"File Uploaded Successfully"})
},(error,req,res,next)=>{ //error:{message} due to multer thats why the different way to show a error message.
    res.send({showError:error.message})
})
